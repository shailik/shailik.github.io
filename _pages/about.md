I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am affiliated with Sanghani Center of Artficial Intelligence and am currently advised by Dr Chang-Tien Lu. My expected graduation date is June 2025. My research interest lies at the intersection of  Social Computing, Spatial Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence with a focus on interpretable and explaianable application of ML and AI technique in real world scenarios. With a portfolio that includes journal and conference papers, I actively contribute to the advancement of my field. Beyond academia, I’ve served my institute's student body and administrative body by volunteering for key events such as student orientation and commencement. I've also mentored students at the early stages of their academic career. I’m inspired by the potential of science to affect positive change by highlighting and addressing the inequities of society. I remain firmly committed to harnessing my expertise to make a lasting impact. Outside of my academic pursuits, you may find me either playing ping pong or spending time with my family or both.
